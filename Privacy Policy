Important Legal-Sounding Stuff You Probably Won't Read
By playing Frizzors, you agree to a completely reasonable set of terms, which mostly involve not breaking the game, yourself, or your surroundings. This game is powered by Photon Fusion / PUN 2, meaning that if things go horribly wrong, it’s probably your internet’s fault, not ours.

Things We Collect (Don’t Worry, We’re Not Creeps)
We gather the bare minimum of data needed to keep this game running, such as:

Your username and ID (so we know who to blame for breaking physics).
Game performance metrics (to help us optimize laggy nonsense).
Crash reports (because we know someone out there is trying to launch themselves into the void at Mach 5).
Voice chat data (processed in real-time but not stored—so feel free to scream into the void).
Things We Do NOT Collect (Because We're Not That Evil)
Your personal conversations (unless you voluntarily broadcast them in public chat—at which point, that’s on you).
Payment information (we let the platform handle that, so don’t yell at us if your cat buys 1,000 cosmetics).
GPS data (this isn’t a horror game, we don’t need to know where you live).
Things You Should NOT Do (But Someone Will Try Anyway)
❌ Exploiting or hacking the game. Just don’t. We see everything. Yes, even that.
❌ Physically harming yourself or your furniture while playing. If you punch your TV, that’s between you and your wallet.
❌ Excessive toxicity. Trash talk is fine, but if you make it personal, we’ll personally remove you.

Final Note
This policy may change, because people keep finding new ways to break things. If we update anything major, we’ll try to let you know. Or you’ll just find out the hard way.

Now go, swing your arms, climb like a lunatic, and have fun. But don’t blame us if your arms hurt later.
